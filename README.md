# Anomaly Detection using Sensor Data

This project was created as part of a Kaggle hiring challenge.
The goal is to detect anomalies from sensor readings.

## Approach
- Performed basic data exploration and feature engineering
- Used Logistic Regression as a baseline model
- Improved results using a Random Forest classifier
- Focused on recall and F1-score due to class imbalance

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Note
The dataset is provided by Kaggle and is not included in this repository.
